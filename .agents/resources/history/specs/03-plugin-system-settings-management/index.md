# Plugin System And Settings Management

Status: proposed
Created: 2026-07-02

## Purpose

Define plugin discovery, Codex compatibility, c4os.yaml metadata, settings schema, dependencies, icons, marketplace, and lifecycle.

## Source Boundaries

This spec derives from shared context, references, original goal inputs, and the exact grill answer JSON. It must not depend on sibling specs for project-wide truth.

## Source Routing

- `.agents/references/research/final-implementation-import/adhoc-goals.md`
  Purpose: Original user-stated final implementation goals and task inventory.
  Load when: checking the original requested task inventory or whether scope was imported correctly.
  Skip when: current context and spec records already answer the task.

- `.agents/references/research/final-implementation-import/accepted-instructions.md`
  Purpose: Accepted replay and workflow instructions, including source-of-truth and ADR placement constraints.
  Load when: checking replay instructions, workflow constraints, source-of-truth placement, or migration rules.
  Skip when: current context and spec records already answer the task.

- `.agents/references/research/final-implementation-source-inventory.md`
  Purpose: Inventory of imported final-implementation sources, grill counts, and provenance status.
  Load when: auditing source coverage, imported grill data, or provenance completeness.
  Skip when: current context and spec records already answer the task.

- `.agents/context/product-specs.md`
  Purpose: Shared product behavior, feature surfaces, and customer workflow truth.
  Load when: checking product behavior, workflow, or feature-surface expectations.
  Skip when: the task is unrelated to this source boundary.

- `.agents/context/technical-specs.md`
  Purpose: Shared technical boundaries for runtime, tools, plugins, approvals, persistence, and execution surfaces.
  Load when: checking architecture, runtime, tool, plugin, approval, storage, or execution boundaries.
  Skip when: the task is unrelated to this source boundary.

- `.agents/context/creative-specs.md`
  Purpose: Shared UI, interaction, layout, accessibility, and visual direction.
  Load when: checking shell layout, UI behavior, visual direction, accessibility, or interaction constraints.
  Skip when: the task is unrelated to this source boundary.

- `.agents/context/work-orders.md`
  Purpose: Shared sequencing, guardrails, accepted decisions, and implementation-readiness routing.
  Load when: checking accepted sequencing, guardrails, status, validation needs, or whether work may become active.
